# goal
sup nerds. this is a rewrite in C of [a game i wrote in rust a while ago](github.com/cedric-h/rpg). trying to figure out how much smaller C WASM bundles can be in a much more real-world way. also trying to figure out why it is C feels so much more ergonomic to write. figuring out a real world something and figuring out something about myself along the way. dope.

## deps
